## Ways to Contribute

There are many different ways, in which you may contribute to this project, including:

   * Opening issues by using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rtckit/eqivo/issues)
   * Commenting and expanding on open issues
   * Propose fixes to open issues via a pull request

We suggest that you create an issue on GitHub before starting to work on a pull request, as this gives us a better overview, and allows us to start a conversation about the issue.

We also encourage you to separate unrelated contributions into different pull requests. This makes it easier for us to understand your individual contributions and faster at reviewing them.

## Terms of Service For Contributors

For all contributions to this repository (software, bug fixes, configuration changes, documentation, or any other materials), we emphasize that this happens under GitHubs general Terms of Service and the license of this repository.

### Contributing as an individual

If you are contributing as an individual you must make sure to adhere to:

The [GitHub Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service) __*Section D. User-Generated Content,*__ [Subsection: 6. Contributions Under Repository License](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license):

_"Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.
Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit."_
